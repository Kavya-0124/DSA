     Algorithms: These are the methods of solving problems.
     Data Structures: Store the information associated with the problem.
  
     Data Types: Stack,Queue,Bag, Union-find, priority queue
     Sorting: Quicksort,Mergesort,Heapsort,Radixsorts
     Searching: BST,red-black BST, hash table
     Graphs: BFS,DFS,Prim,Kruskal,Dijkstra

### Why Study Algorithms?


  <details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  
  
   - Their impact is broad and far-reaching.
   - Old roots and new opportunities.
      - Study of algorithms dates at least to Euclid.
      - Formalized by Church and Turing in 1930s.
   - To solve problems that could not otherwise be addressed.
      - Eg. Network Connectivity.
   - For intellectual stimulations.
      - ***Francis Sullivan- For me great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse,allusive,dense and even mysterious. But once
        unlocked, they cast a rilliant new light on some aspect of computing.***

  <summary>Steps to developing a usable algorithm</summary>
  
   - Model the problem.
   - Find an algorithm to solve it.
   - Fast enough? Fits in memory?
   - If not, figure out why.
   - Find a way to address the problem.
   - Iterate until satisfied.
