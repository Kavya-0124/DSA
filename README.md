### Why Study Algorithms?


  <details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  
  
     > Their impact is broad and far-reaching.
     > Old roots and new opportunities.
       >> Study of algorithms dates at least to Euclid.
       >> Formalized by Church and Turing in 1930s.
     > To solve problems that could not otherwise be addressed.
       >> Eg. Network Connectivity.
     >For intellectual stimulations.
     ***Francis Sullivan- For me great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse,allusive,dense and even mysterious. But once unlocked, they cast a rilliant new light on some aspect of computing.***
